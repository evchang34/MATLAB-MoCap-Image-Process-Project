# MATLAB-MoCap-Image-Process-Project

This project tracks joint motion using LED markers and MATLAB-based image processing techniques. Each frame of the input video is analyzed to locate marker positions using a combination of custom and built-in functions. The extracted marker data is used to calculate velocity vectors. The results are visualized through time-series plots and also overlaid onto the original video to create an annotated motion capture output. 

- mocap_Chang.m processes gait footage to analyze walking patterns
- mocap_pt2_Chang.m processes footage of a participant shooting a basketball
- mocap1 videos are the outputs for the gait analysis
- mocap2 videos are the outputs for the basketball shooting analysis
